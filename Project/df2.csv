0, The car park was small and unpleasant People with Mercedes and BMWs took over 2 spaces We were lucky to get a space after driving around about 10 times ,3.0
1, We weren t told that the only spa facility open was the pool and the sauna but we had already paid and had to find out ourselves when entering the spa area ,0.6666666666666666
2, I asked how far the O2 was and got told a 7 minute walk no no way it was 2 trains away being on my own I was not very happy other than that it was ok,1.0
3, Hot stuffy room air con not working properly Filthy windows Wallpaper ripped and worn bedside furniture tatty carpets worn and damaged bathroom door latch worn making door difficult to open from the inside Shower from another era controlled by bath taps Poor shower curtain too resulting in wet floor Carpets in corridors worn out and tatty nasty musty aroma to these areas too All in all this place is around ten years overdue a complete renovation ,1.0
4, Although the price seems like it is cheap you have to pay extra for everything like the swimming pool and Wifi which can fool you and sometimes comes to the same as others if not more with extras like breakfast and all ,2.75
5, The hotel has seen better days including the stairwell carpets which were quite threadbare The common parts are in need of decoration The quality of the towels in the bathroom was not too good and there was only one set of toiletries for two people There was an item of drug paraphernalia in the hall ,2.5
6, Construction going on all around the hotel so many paths closed Had to pay extra to use hotel pool and spa which was a health hazard in itself Stairs leading to changing rooms and pool were filthy pool tiles didn t look like they had ever been cleaned wood was rotted in the sauna floor had food and hair on it outside The shower outside sauna had a hot and a cold button had to press both at same time in order not to scald or freeze yourself Pasta in pizzaria was microwaved Staff were incredibly rude in all areas of the hotel at one point my aunt was asked to repeat if you understand now The wifi was incredibly slow and power points or lack there of were very dated like the decor in whole hotel The only part of this review I gave more than a sad face was the location I wouldn t even give the hotel a 2 ,0.2
7, Room was far too hot and air conditioning didn t work Happened on my previous stay and a staff member had to open a window with a screwdriver Unfortunately the huge vents outside were really noisy with the window open Hardly slept all night ,3.0
8, The guy that served us was not very professional as he was telling us about other customers situation and we just wanted to get to our room The car park was so small and there was no parking at all My car was stuck between two cars all they told us he was a first come first serve Was not very happy at all ,2.5
9, The building site next door Dirty windows spoiling lovely view See photos ,1.6666666666666667
10, Access was a little tricky due to local construction works in the area but these did not adversely impact on my journey time or cause any noise issues inside the hotel ,1.75
11, ,4.0
12, The staff were not at all welcoming I would go so far as to say jaded if not unhappy at obe point seen arguing with a customer in front of customers The double bed I selected wasn t a double bed at all but two single beds zipped together and very poorly and uncomfortably at that So cheap Such a bad sleep There were mice scurrying around all over the property in full view of customers from the main lobby to near the dining and bar areas to inside my room where I saw mice on two occasions during my stay The room itself had too much wear and tear with walls visibly stained marked and damaged and the toilets showing mould in the shower Totally careless I asked for a non smoking room but the room I got reeked of smoke everywhere from the curtains to the toilet So bad I want a full refund ,2.0
13, The lifts were badly adjusted with dangerous gaps between the leading edges og the car doors ,0.6666666666666666
14, Parking was horrible The parking garage is very narrow and we drove in and out again when noticng it was full Near the entrance of the garage there were 3 members of staff walking around who did not inform anyone At least 4 other cars behind us drove in and back out again Then I walked up to ask where else we could park in the area and were told to just check out all the side streets and park there Then we drove around to find out that all parking there is for residents only After 30 minutes or so when then parked at the westferry circus garage which is a 10 minute walk away Since the garage did not mention maximum duration of parking we On the hotel itself the furnishings are a little outdated The carpets on the stairs for instance are quite worn Wifi did not work There was a card in the room with details but the network could not be found on either of the phones we had with The room itself was nice and clean Beware of the shower Water pressure is very good but the screen in front of the bath is fairly small so if you do not twist the shower head to the wall for an inch or so the whole bathroom will get wet The head is fixed to the wall and people over approx 1 85 m will not be able to stand under without squatting a little If I would have paid full price for this hotel frankly I would have been very disappointed Comparing to some 3 and 4 star hotels in London I have visited this hotel is more a 3 than a 4 star based on room comfort staff and parking ,2.0
15, Every part of this stay was horrendous From start to finish When we arrived the sockets did not work so could not charge our phones before heading out for dinner The room was dirty I Woke up in the morning to the bathroom flooded water had come all the way out to the room wetting bags shoes toiletry bags etc Could not get reception on phone for ages Nobody came to clean the mess could not get hold of a GM breakfast was awful Dry toast was all we could stomach eating as place was so dirty Needless to say we are in process of looking for a full refund from the hotel ,1.0
16, NOTHING,1.6666666666666667
17, Bathroom could of been to a better standard but everything in the bathroom did work perfectly fine ,4.0
18, The phone wasn t working in the room The steam room was out of action They the Sheff wasn t there to make sandwiches all day on menu there was no body there to do the massage in spa And when I mentioned my concerns to the staff and management they seemed not bothered about the issues Or to give a solution All round I think the the management and staff need to listen to the guests You can t offer these facilities without providing them ,1.0
19, Nothing it was great ,8.0
20, Hotel is very tired and overpriced for what it is Needs knocking down and replacing or complete renovation Beds poor with thin mattresses 2 singles pushed together to be a double etc ,1.0
21, The room I had could do with a bit of a spruce up especially the the en suite bathroom However it was all clean The Pizzeria in the hotel served very poor food The Indian retaurant in the hotel served deceent food ,1.5
22, As above,0.5
23, WiFi is not for free which felt a bit like early 2000 s,1.0
24, The fire alarm went off and no one said anything i wasnt sure if i needed to get out or not but by the time i put my clothing back on from swimming the alarm atopped so i stayed in my room also when i went swimming noe one told me i had to sign in this is something reception shld have told me whn i checked in as i did ask her the swimming times,2.6666666666666665
25, Staff Those of you with poker faces you should smile more you should ask a guest whether is in a need of help with luggage not just whether he she wants to pay in advance for breakfast or open an account with you or whether would prefer a more expensive room Also saying good morning and good evening to your guests once in a while is good manners Looking like a gentleman won t make you one after all it s not everything in life about money Wifi Rooms with windows at an extra charge of 20 pounds day Taxi companies you co operate with that instead of 5 mins they turn up in 35 It s not your fault entirely but most definitely not your guests ,4.0
26, ,2.5
27, ,4.0
28, There was no toilet brush The bathroom was generally threadbare There was no ability to tightly close the window therefore it was very cold in the night Also guests next door were pretty loud ,7.0
29, Hotel and staff a little sad need a bit of updating sprucing up Lovely to have a pool but the whole area was not very clean and needs more than a lick of paint ,4.0
30, The rooms did not look like the ones on the picture I had to change rooms because the first one was not what I expected Booked two single beds however the beds were only one armlength apart The closet door was broken Whn I asked the receptionist about the room on the pictures displayed on booking com I was told that those rooms do not exist Staff was friendly enough to over us a different room which was okay The furnishing was really outdated I was shocked that this is supposed to be a four star hotel There was no air conditioning in the room While it was only 15 C outside the roomtemperature was around 28 5 C Turning on the air ventilation was in vain and also incredibly loud ,0.3333333333333333
31, The angle of the TV was a bit annoying it was postioned facing away from the bed which I thought to be very strange The bathroom floor was quite slippy I nearly slipped and died The room was so hot too The air con just didn t do it any justice We couldn t feel it at all Due to the old fashioned theme of the hotel I believe they could probably upgrade the air con and possibly modernise it a bit more The armchairs though comfortable did have a huge rip down the back of it which I thought was a bit crude considering the location and the amount of visitors they must have ,2.6666666666666665
32, Rooms on the first floor do not have air conditioning Our rooms were unbearably hot Breakfast was poor ,0.5

35, There was no water in the complimentry tray with tea and coffee There is NO fridge Carpet are old and smelly WiFi not available in rooms No free parking ,1.0
36, At breakfast not shown to table or offered tea or coffee Tables filthy standard of food appalling had a few mouthfuls and left Check out only one person checking guests out as another left to work in back office Not asked about my stay and not interested in me as a customer or future business Does not compare to the Hilton Group ,5.0
37, Hotel very tired don t see how it can be classed as 4star room ver hot no airconditon no windows in some rooms,0.5
38, Staff achieved the bare minimum of helpfulness but no desire to add value or go the extra mile Room was mostly clean but glasses in bathroom and and other objects were dusty ,1.0
39, Bathroom was old dirty and dated The basin did not work and the shower which was incorporated in the bath did not work well The breakfast was awful the coffee tasted bad the bacon smelt off there was little choice no continental option or very little the food looked unappealing and stale The cutlery plates and cups were dirty and felt greasy I tried to eat but felt distgusted and bought breakfast outside the hotel ,1.0
40, We couldn t stay all night as parking was full and there wasn t any parking nearby A quick call to reception for advise was unhelpful as they advised it was unsafe to park anywhere else The hotel parking on its own did not seem too secure either There is no access from the parking levels straight into the hotel pedestrians have to walk up and down the same way as cars go which is risky and a tad inconvenient too ,1.6666666666666667
41, Beds not comfy tried to charge us 20 night to upgrade to a room with windows when we had a room with windows anyway Booked a double room and given a twin room with 2beds pushed together complained changed room to a double Rooms very dated and old ,1.0
42, Cumbersome check in process poor wifi connectivity quality of breakfast should be better it should have a separate breakfast room or serving point for large groups of travelling children ,1.0
43, Breakfast was rubbish with the restaurant more like a canteen in Butlins ,2.5
44, The room was shabby with worn carpet and furniture The bed was uncomfortable The breakfast was disorganised and not of a quality that would be expected of a large city hotel Wifi was not really usable due to 20min per day Having to pay extra for hotel facilities eg pool ,3.0
45, Extremely disappointing No free Internet in room and you have to pay for every device you want connected once per day The breakfast buffet was not good For example the yogurt had the consistency of water The room itself had cracked yellow water stained drywall or plaster ceiling Sink didn t drain A C somewhat worked but the vent was almost plugged with dust They staff was definitely not very friendly but did their job adequately You ll survive a stay here but you aren t likely to particularly enjoy it I ve stayed at many roadside motels over the years that were cleaner nicer and a way way better value This is not a 4 star hotel experience If you arrive with the mindset that it s a place to sleep and won t be eating there won t need Internet won t spend any time in your room and don t sweat small stuff like a sink that won t drain it will be okay Otherwise probably try somewhere else ,7.0
46, It was very old fashioned and tired looking in many areas Would definitely benifit from a refit The shower in our room was very basic and sprayed all over the place which was very annoying while trying to get ready The plug socket nearest to the bed was an original fitting and so couldn t actually be used with a modern plug Very basic overall rough around the edges ,0.8333333333333334
47, The rooms aircon was noisy and not very effective The view was a aircon unit upon a roof and the whole experience made me feel I was back in the 80 s We stopped there as I was attending a conference at The Excell Centre and when I typed in hotels close to the Docklands it bought this one up It was close to the other side of the Docklands which then still cost us 15 in a cab to reach Shame as booking com have let themselves down with this hotel ,1.0
48, Unfortunately the rooms are a bit dated and the carpet could have been cleaner as there were stains on it ,2.0
49, Hotel staff was not cooperating at all Beds were separated Spring Mattress were paining in back like hell Bathroom sinks were choked Had to brush in Bath tubs Cleaning staff was pathetic Swimming pool was chargeable Internet wi fi was free for a whole 20 minute session in whole day and that too in hotel lobby and not in room Overall the property was not value for money at all and staying there was a nightmare ,1.0
50, The room had no air conditioning and the windows don t open and the heat was well in the 20c all night building work a few yards off the building so the windows are dirty staff very good ,2.5
51, No air conditioning in rooms When paying over 100 a night you would expect air con However the room did have a little fan to help blow the hot air around the room Also I left some expensive items in the bathroom but when I called the next day the receptionist informed me nothing was handed in Can t say surprised but very disappointed ,0.25
52, wifi was a bit complicated you are allowed to use free wifi 2 times for 20 min in a day in the room if you want all day hotel requests extra money but in the lobby area it was free so people were sitting in the lobby area on the evenings ,0.5714285714285714
53, Wifi not free after 30 mins really considering it s 2017 Electric sockets near bed side were unusable as they were 3 pin again It s 2017 the rooms need to facilitate modern technology use and ease of access Food price good but bland bland bland Poor mass produced deserts,1.25
54, Overpriced No good value for money ,0.5
55, Nothing,0.6
56, She room upstairs are a bit dated and the lefts take forever to come had to use the stairs at one point ,4.0
57, The staffs who were there in the morning don t use words called thank you and sorry We couldn t have breakfast because there was a very long queue When we requested for a refund for the breakfast the lady at the check out counter gave us a rude look and said non refundable A polite word would do the magic The food at the Indian restaurant was not up to the mark ,4.0
58, The hotel was a bit far from the sight seeing and tourist activities that we had planned The walk to the underground was a bit far also Spent a lot of time traveling to and from London Center Also the construction made finding the entrance difficult and it was a bit noisy ,3.3333333333333335
59, The facilities and decoration are so old ,0.6
60, The queue for the breakfast was very long and not worth waiting in Very expensive for what the hotel offered and there is nothing around the hotel at all The tube station is around a 5 10min walk ,2.0
61, There was a strange sound through the whole of the night and called the manager to try and fix the problem Next day he said the problem was fixed after he sent a maintenance team The second night of course the sound was there It was a sound which resembled a phone vibrating which come from the ceiling bathroom For the 4 star rating is not acceptable Another issue there was not any fridge in the room ,4.0
62, The bed was like sleeping on a chain link fence and the neighbors and hallway were noisy ,2.0
63, I know I booked a budget room but I didn t realize rooms without windows even existed anymore but that s what I got Nor did it have air conditioning Just a fan The daytime temperatures were about 30 degrees so I had two uncomfortable nights Had I known all this in advance I probably would have paid more for something better or an Airbnb I actually dreamed about being on holiday in North Korea It was that good My other gripe was the length of time it took to get a beer Short queues at the bar took forever to get to the front of mainly because people were buying huge rounds of drinks The bar girl did her best but the odds were stacked against her More bar staff might be an idea Plenty of people without my determination and unquenchable thirst gave up and I don t blame them My third and final gripe is the external camouflage of the hotel which is labelled the P Hotel outside with no obvious clue as to its claimed name of Britannia International For a non London dweller like me simple things like this matter quite a lot when I am hot and tired and lost ,1.375
64, No mention of an extra charge for leisure facilities online or when checked in Had to go up to the room again to get cash When queried this at reception the lady was unhelful unfriendly and unapologetic One manager was very friendly and helpful however other staff did not smile or make conversation Leisure facilities were very poor The rest of the hotel was clean and tidy Leisure area carpet was filthy dirty rubbish bag on the floor carpet looked like it had not been hoovered Sauna was cold pool was cold pool area was outdated including walls peeling generally run down Dirty flannel at side of hot tub ,3.5
65, The rooms need a bit of a facelift The double bed is made up of two singles stuck together New carpet is needed ,0.5
66, My experience with this hotel was quite bad as follows When we had arrived we were not greeted at the entrance by any concierge or bellboy and left to us to take our luggage into the hotel ourselves but once we got to the front desk I began speaking to one of the staff and was rudely interrupted by another most likely more senior staff who insisted on assisting with my check in Once all of the particulars were given it was time to speak about the payment even though I had already made the booking and payment through booking com What annoyed me tremendously is the way in which I was spoken to it seems many hotels in London have staff with attitude problems where they speak to guests as if they cannot afford the stay so to speak Quite infuriating and pretty much set the precedent for the rest of the stay The bed was ridiculously small for 2 people if you make a half turn from the centre of the bed you are already at the edge of the bed Good luck if you toss and turn during sleep don t be surprised to find yourself waking up on the floor The room looked tired and unattractive the carpets were frayed inside the room and in the corridor and all of the furniture in the room was worn and tired I approached the front desk requesting assistance in organising a chauffeured ride to Heathrow Airport and instead of assisting me the front desk staff just told me to speak to the concierge Nothing wrong with that but the problem in this case was that there was no human being at the concierge desk which was right across on the right hand side of the staff member All she had to do was look to the right and she would have seen there was no one there In any case I walked across waiting 10 minutes for someone to come but no one appeared which was quite disturbing I just gave up in the end and used an online booking service instead ,1.1875
67, ,1.6666666666666667
68, The coffee was undrinkable The air con was pathetic When 2 coach loads of new guests all arrived together it took 3 4 of an hour to be able to use the lifts ,1.0
69, Hotel a little tired needs a refurb and surrounded by a building g site at the moment,0.75
70, The staff at reception should have greeted us with a smile They did get more smiley after my partner made a joke or two but it had to be prompted ,2.0
71, Paid for wifi in 2017 Really Even the free 20 minutes wouldn t let me VPN or tunnel traffic to access remote systems for my work just basic browsing possible I travel to Canary Wharf for business most weeks this one problem puts Britannia at the bottom of the accommodation options for me The windows were dirty outside so the advantage of a good viewpoint was negated Windows wouldn t open aircon not up to the job min temp max fan and the room was still too warm it would have been fine if a window was able to be opened Furnishings decor were functionally fine but a little dated and shabby ,3.0
72, Uncomfortable bed pillow Windows didn t open and air con was very poor Shower flooded entire bathroom and fell off wall continually when spoke to reception rude stated it s hand held only didn t say that in their description of facilities Breakfast was horrible and general cleanliness in dining room poor,5.0
73, Staff response to friend being locked int he toilet as a disappointing they found it very amusing and did nothing to reassure the person trapped No apology was provided nor anything done to temporarily fix the issue which had happened before ,4.0
74, The service at check in was poor There were four staff but only one was dealing with customers waiting to check in There was no safe or fridge in the room Use of in room internet was 7 00 and use of security boxes was chargeable as well Poor selection of tea and coffee options in the room no decaffeinated alternatives ,3.0
75, Use of pool and gym had to be paid for That was a bit disappionting Building need a bit of maintenance ,3.0
76, Due to all the building works locally getting to the hotel wasn t easy not helped by reception staff giving you the wrong information about the quickest route which was closed Waited 15mins for bar staff to serve me and then gave up ,0.5
77, The room was surprisingly spacious and the theme was jovial it felt like an escape It was a brilliant location and tube links to other parts of London made it easy to reach our play on time The cocktails were good We got in late from our play and there was good food available but could have been better ,3.0
78, The hotel was quite impersonal The view from the window was a little off putting It looked straight out onto the river It was like being on board ship or staying in Venice ,2.3333333333333335
79, Absence of safe box in a room No fridge Wifi is free for only 20 minutes a day Fungus in bathroom room 933 Air conditioning was poor ,0.5
80, The whole hotel is very tired old fashioned and over furnished The air con only put out 30 degree heat so it was really difficult to get the room cool The view was good but there is a building going up right next door so that view of the water isn t going to last long There is a reason why its cheap in the area but if its value for location rather than pretty surroundings you re looking for this is it ,8.0
81, The breakfast was disorganised chaos a lot of food was under cooked or not available our table was cleared whilst we waited for food on the first day Our table was used as a dumping ground for pots by a waitress who was clearing another table and when we complained to one of the waitresses it was met by a shrug of the shoulders and raised hands to indicate what could she do about it ,1.0
82, No hot water Stayed 3 nights and only managed 1hot shower Breakfast was hit and missed first two mornings was fine but it was cold on the 3rd morning but also crazy busy too ,2.5
83, Room wifi should be provided for free And TV screen was small for the room ,2.0
84, Could do with a spruce up a lot of building work going on,0.42857142857142855
85, Staff extremely rude and unhelpful at check in and when I asked to speak to the Hotel manager the next morning he must have attended the same charm school as his staff as his attitude was just as dismissive ,1.0
86, Just a little tired had to ask for bath towels which were then supplied promptly and could not get a nightcap Baileys when returning around midnight Main bars closed Pizza place only served beer and wine ,2.0
87, Got what I thought was a special offer price that seemed more like a price for substandard experience Hard to find the room corridors like a Warren with paper signs that were worn and grubby No porter and a dismissive point from the concierge to get a trolley ourselves Once maneuvered onto correct floor had to get two very heavy cases and two smaller up 6 stairs then get them through the maze of corridors that were semi blocked with maids trolleys The hotel felt more like a hostel with crowds of youngsters congregating in the lobby for coaches then in the evening slouched over the sofas some asleep Every morning we were woken early by loud shouting down the corridors from what appeared to possibly be construction workers Most awful hotel experience I ve ever had which constrasted greatly with that when this hotel first opened Staff were also unwelcoming Would never stay there again ,1.0
88, Nothing ,1.4285714285714286
89, We had a double bed that was hard and had no valance that made it look rather tatty The wash hand basin tap in the bathroom didn t work which we complained about immediately but was never repaired We were initially given a room on the second floor that looked out over a flat roof complete with full black plastic bags We complained and were then given a room on the 8th floor that was much better ,2.6666666666666665
90, The hotel needs refurbishment as it looks very tired My partner and I had a room with stains on the carpet and cob webs in the window ,3.0
91, Room didn t have a window which we were aware of but there was no air con Very hot small room Expected a bit more for the amount we paid Hotel was tired needs a bit of TLC WOULDN T STAY AGAIN ,1.0
92, No free wifi and everything was 1000 yrs old and tired even the staff but i felt sorry for them cos it wasnt their fault ,1.0
93, For the money 350 it was an awful place tired needs redecorating not even biscuits in the room or a shower gown and slippers Absolutely appalling ,1.0
94, AC was bit noisy but worked well There s a 20 min complimentary wifi available in the lobby and I was able to connect to that from my fourth floor room as well but if you need a faster connection for work and 24 7 use it costs seven pounds per day In these times when free fast wifi is everywhere I would highly recommend the hotel management to consider wifi revamp ,1.5
95, Some of the reception team spoke little English and you had to write a note for them to pass on No decaff coffee sachets available for the room,1.3333333333333333
96, There can t still be many hotels that still charge for Wi Fi in the room Just tethered my phone but I still find it annoying and a disincentive to book again Also is it usual to charge residents for use of the gym Don t book breakfast at time or reservation or charge breakfast to room Book breakfast when you check in for 30 cheaper for what is otherwise a rather expensive but average buffet breakfast weird but useful to know ,1.0
97, the internet wifi not good at all its not free the room was so hot no air condition at all also the windows not open view was bad the room was not sea view,1.0
98, The bed was too hard very noisy as there was construction work next to the hotel which was also our view ,6.0
99, Think the beds could be comfier If we weren t so tired from all the walking during the day think it would have been a bit of struggle to get a good nights sleep But then again if it had a refurb the price would go up ,3.0
100, Reception staff were unfriendly one was extremely un cooperative about check out procedures Room was shabby and the tea coffee provision was very poor Toiletries also poor Overpriced for what was provided and has definitely gone downhill since I first stayed there several years ago ,1.6666666666666667
101, The room was quite large could have done with a small fridge The bath towels were a little too thin in texture I would have expected them to be a bit larger than they were The mattress was a little too hard for our liking ,0.75
102, I arrived around 11pm and the reception staff were being helpful sorting out people whose rooms didn t have aircon and a group with a billing question but it meant I had to wait 45 minutes to check in There were other staff in the office who I felt should have noticed there was a queue and come out to help Both single beds in the room were very basic narrow beds which looked and felt rather temporary the bed was comfortable enough but it seemed a bit cheeky for the price That plus getting only 20 minutes free wifi made it feel slightly over priced ,1.0
103, The air con in our room was broken on the hottest day of the year we were unable to open the windows fans were provided but they only succeeded in pushing hot air around The extractor fan in the bathroom didn t work at all and we ended up sleeping with the door open as the air con was working in the corridors I don t think we would stay again,3.0
104, When I booked my confirmation screen said wifi parking and swimming pool were included but when I arrived reception told me I would need to pay an extra 4 per day to use the pool and gym Also the wifi is only free in the lobby so the way this location is advertised on Booking com is really deceiving and unfair ,2.0
105, Staff attitude Hot room Air conditioning not working long story but we asked 5 times and nothing was done even though they said it would Shower broken Furniture old and tatty Tea making facilities minimal Many other problems ,1.0

108, The staff s attitude and the hot room,1.0
109, Would have been better if you didn t have to pay 7 for wifi per device per room that is far too expensive,7.0
110, I booked the room through booking com but when we arrived the lady at the front desk said for the price I paid on this site we d have a room with no windows They offered an upgrade to a superior double room with king size bed on the top floor for 30 The only truth in the upgrade was the top floor bit The bed was smaller than a standard double there were flies in the room and was not superior to anything I spoke to the manager about the problems and he offered a room change we d already unpacked and got as settled as we could so all I wanted was the upgrade money back That didn t happen The breakfast the next morning was not worth the 10 each The bacon was like cardboard the eggs didn t taste right and the whole breakfast was a huge let down So the price started on here as 73 I ended up paying 150 which included 24hr parking the upgrade and breakfast for 2 Not impressed with any of it a Premier Inn would have been the better option ,1.3333333333333333
111, Old style My room was a Den I had to pay 20 to upgrade Wif fi is chargeable and the staff at check in was not helpful i asked the lady 3 times to explain to me what I had access to etc she kept showing directions lol Great location needs revamp but some may like that style ,1.0

114, If you wanted to use the pool you had to pay extra That was a bit much considered I paid over 100 for one night Would not go again based on that,1.0
115, The Bar seemed to close very early on the Saturday night which was a bit of a pity we were given 10 minuted to get our last orders in and when I got up 2 minutes late to order our drinks we were told the time was up and the barman closed a rail in my face We then spoke to the Barman who agreed to serve us our last drinks as there were a few people also in our predicament However it did put a sour taste in our mouths as it was our first night there and the following night we went to another pub instead ,1.1428571428571428
116, Friendly staff quiet location beautiful hotel relaxing and welcoming with a fantastic range of cuisine from the restaurant ,2.0
117, 1 Coffee at breakfast was simply vile Large flasks of stewed tepid bitter coffee Yuk 2 The whole place is at best tired and old fashioned at worst grubby dusty dilapidated 3 The entire surroundings are construction sites with high rise concrete buildings springing up This meant that the most convenient route to the hotel from the tube or DLR are all blocked requiring a detour Also work on the nearest site 20 yards from our bedroom window began at 7 30 drilling clanging of scaffolding yelling etc We would have expected to be told about this at the time of booking ,1.5
118, Everything was bad wifi wasnt working charging port wasn t near bed Reception was trying to tell me to upgrade my room Food was pathetic and the attitude if staff was also bad and disrespectful For room service it was additional 5 pounds Probably the worst hotel i have ever stayed in Not recommend at all,1.0

122, No wash cloths staff didn t even understand what they were Room had no A C but they offered to open the windows Moved us to a room supposedly with A C but it was a smoking room windows kept opening so dirt dust as well as residual smell from smoking made room unbearable Furnishings were all nicked up carpet dirty sofa stained and hot water control on shower so sensitive you either had cold or scalding water ,1.0
123, The room was unclean I booked a double room but was apparently upgraded to a suite which had 2 single beds pushed together The room temperature would not drop below 26 degrees no water in the room which I find in this day and age and at the cost we paid was unacceptable the room was in need of a refurbishment the shower was either red hot or freezing cold The windows in the downstairs bar were absolutely filthy the air con also didn t work anywhere on the ground floor The furniture in the downstairs bar and foyer area need replacing as it had pieces of tape holding splits in the leather together The staff behind reception were grumpy and were not helpful at all the staff in breakfast were all young children and were lacking leadership and needed to be motivated there were many tables uncleaned with the previous persons plates still sat there the presentation of the food looked rushed and was chucked in dishes to try and keep up with the masses of people queuing to get into breakfast I actually went in for breakfast early prior to going for a meeting and was waiting so long I had to leave as I would have been late for my meeting The staff in the bar were actually very nice and did there best for us ,1.0

133, The main issue of the hotel has been temperature When I arrived there were 34C degrees in the room not a good start After one hour of maximum AC still 34 degrees Management offered a fan but that didn t help and the night turned into a nightmare Windows can not be opened It is not acceptable to let guests sleep in a room with 34C degrees The next night I had to keep the door open for a couple of hours to get the temperature to drop a little It was not a problem of my room as I talked to other guests and they were all experiencing the same Breakfast quite basic and this would be OK but a small buffet at the end of a stretched room meant a long queue to just get some fruits In a nutshell don t get this hotel in summer especially if you re traveling for business Not a good idea to have a business meeting after a restless night soaked ,3.5

155, There is a lot to improve here This hotel needs a huge renovation Everything is old and not in a comfortable and artistic way starting from the furnitures the elevators floors and bathroom facilities It s definitely not a 5 star hotel and not even close to it The staff was not welcoming at all Toilet amenities were cheap and of a bad quality The hairdryer was very old The carpeted floor was dusty Even being at the 11th floor the room was very noisy I could hear the train and what the neighbour walking up the stairs The elevator would stop at every floor when going down And let s not talk about the breakfast very poor quality the fruit must have been there since ages and there is no coffee service I asked for an espresso and the waiter wouldn t even know what it was I am often in London but I will try to stay away from this hotel as much as it s possible in the area Such an historical building should be much more evaluated and its potentially very nice furnitures really need a management who cares and understands international standards ,7.0

232, I admit that I was tempted by the very convenient price but this comes with a price The hotel is the classic charter mass tourism place Buses continuously offloading million of noisy and hungry tourists The hotel itself appear sort of old England style up to the first steps and then it becomes a monks style environment especially the bedroom cell Definitely a never again ,0.5
233, The whole Place needs a refurbishment The staff in general were unhelpful and often replied in rude or dismissive manner On numerous occasions and I am very polite They badly need retraining for pleasantness and consideration The door staff basically refused to gather luggage from friend or use trolley to take to my room one wheeled smallest case and left us to struggle with the biggest part The only nice pleasant girl I met was the chambermaid The bed was lumpy The towels were small old and hard The TV was poorly placed on furthest wall Not enough plugs and sockets Bedside lights did not work No one answering reception phones on many occasions Coffee in flasks at breakfast was foul Poor bread selection And poor fruit selection Breakfast dry and disappointing Unable to get room service at all as no one replied ,3.5

242, Room was cold with very loud air conditioning but there were no controls in the room to turn it off Room did not have a window which we knew at booking but we did not realise that this would mean that the room would be really hidden away from the other rooms almost as if you were in the staff quarters No one directed us to our room and as the rooms numbers did not follow in numerical order it took us over 15 minutes to locate our room We were actually over the other end of the building to the other room numbers that were in the 100 s rather than with them Mould on the shower curtain was also not a very nice surprise ,1.0

318, The room smelt of old stale smoke It was a none smoking floor so it was either the airconditioning filters that needed changing or the room was close to an external vent where people were smoking The room was on the 10th floor so it wasn t close to an outside smoking area Very puzzling Also the furniture and decor in the room was looking scratched marked and aged Though the room was clean it certainly was overdue for a refurbishment considering it s a 4 hotel in Canary Wharf ,5.0
319, I think the hotel was overpriced for a 4 I have stayed in numerous 4 hotels and this has to be one of the worst I had paid for a double room but when I arrived I found that it was two single beds pushed together they didn t even put on a double quilt There was an annoying green neon light situated above the door which I couldn t turn off It illuminated the room and as a result I had a poor night s sleep I would recommend looking at other hotels in the docklands area ,8.0

325, The very good Canary Wharf view would have been even better if the windows were clean The lobby area was often populated with people using the free WiFi option evidence that the paid option of 7 Pounds is far too high I suggest you trial a promotional offer of 50 off for a week your revenue will easily exceed current levels and your lobby area won t look like a Public Library ,2.0
326, Nothing It was amazing ,7.0
327, I think the hotel could do with a bit more attention to detail when it comes to presentation I feel it could do with a bit of a revamp It s a classic looking hotel which is great compared to all the newer buildings However if it was maintained a to a greater standard if the windows and rooms etc were kept that little bit more gleaming it would have much greater ambiance ,3.3333333333333335

337, I was in room 171 which was quite small and the low ceiling combined with no windows felt a bit like a cave I don t really understand why you charge more for a window Surely a window is the standard for a room Also I think the air conditioning is broken as both mornings at 7 15am I was awoken by it making a very loud clanging sound for about 30 minutes until I was unable to get back to sleep Also the charger on the bathroom light was broken so I was unable to charge my electric toothbrush ,1.0

344, The entire hotel is in need of an upgrade you can see that once upon a time it was a very opulent setting but now it is simply run down and in serious need of a face lift Our room was near the staff section and so there was a loud noise early morning which woke us and we also had a surprise visit from a member of staff around 6 30 whom I assume mistook our room for another Certainly not 4 but for the price it is good enough ,2.3333333333333335

360, We had a pizza in your pizzeria on the evening of April 12th The base was soggy and undercooked The toppings were tasteless Probably the worst pizza we have ever had It cost us about 10 00 which I would like refunded The marketing ploy of advertising relatively cheap accommodation i e without a window And offering an upgrade for 20 00 per night is somewhat we could have done without ,1.0

368, long story short Girlfriend booked a room there was no ac window broken and cant be opened needed another room hotel said only twin rooms available but I checked online and there was a double So I had to book the double and pay for it So we are paying for 2 rooms because of the hotel This all seemed unethical and the heat in the room was frankly dangerous I moved on from this but was still annoyed but what felt like the unfair loss of 65 The next day we moved to another room that the hotel said was cooler and it was for a moment but again there was no AC and no window so the heat eventually stated to build up The cleaner barely cleaned the room when asked to and attempted to just flip over the dirty pillow cases instead of changing them Asked for a fan 3 times before receiving one Attempted to complain politely a number of times 1st manager said he could do nothing Customer services said to contact booking com to attempt to get a refund as if booking com put us in a room where the heating was broken and stuck as 28 degrees and booking com could try and get a refund if the hotel is and I quote WILLING to cooperate Last complaint was to an AWFUL AWFUL manager who essentially said I had to accept the fact that I spent a ridiculous amount of money on a second room that day as hard luck Gave a half assed apology I ll admit to being rude myself but felt justified This isnt as detailed as I would like but in short I kept extending my stay here because the location is the most convenient for my work but this place is just awful and non of the prices justifiable for a 3 star hotel 7 for 24hour of internet on 1 device In 2017 What a joke Sadly just not a funny one ,6.0

377, by far the worst hotel i ve been to in ages mind i am in a different one every week things just don t work staff contradict each other on several occasions for me food is below all standards except the indian restaurant that one is decent there are all sorts of weird hacks like paper ticket vouchers for breakfast in the 21st century and a clamped paper jacket for your magnetic keycard that gets stamped with a red or black stamp to indicate whether your card was preauthorised just look at the irony of that an exchange office that they claim they have but can t exchange 40 on the grounds that they do not have that amount of cash yet then suddenly can when you ask if they are having a laugh and then claim they can t provide you with a receipt for that transaction until you repeat the question about having a laugh when they suddenly can the evening receptionist telling you you can sort everything out upon check out at 4 30am yet the night one next morning insisting it s impossible to charge you and print an invoice until you have a severe fall out and then suddenly everything is possible this booking for an extra day had to be done online because upon my arrival according to the reception they do not do bookings in the hotel i wonder what would have happened if i insisted they did i d booked it immediately upon my arrival and was told everything was settled only to be literally thrown out of my room and told i had to check in again on the last day unfortunately all of that sums up into a strong and lasting impression resembling a cheap sharm el sheikh holiday facility rather than a canary wharf establishment charging 100 quid a night for the room alone ,1.0

425, The hotel is a bit dated but has a good location Our carpets were ripped and coming off the floor he bathroom had a strange smell We were on the 7th floor and after a tiring day going around London all we needed was a good sleep only to be woken around 3 am by a drunk woman banging on someone else s door We rang reception who then came and got the woman out but she was back within half an hour which meant we didn t sleep thereafter The staff the next morning did not offer an apology and told us they were unaware this had happened We were given an email address to complain if we felt like it ,1.0
426, The staff and the manager are lacking adequate customer care The facilities in the room were dated likewise the decorations The toilet seat was broken on checking in the room and after been reported to the reception was told to come down from 10th floor to the reception to collect new magnetic door card for another room Only by citing lack of customers due care that the reception changes the decision to send someone to bring the new card and show us the new room having to carried our luggages without offering assistance The second room too has a poor t v reception and only to report that once again and to be told that it will take almost 25minutes for someone to come and resolve the issue It was a real nightmare and poor value for money despite the upgrade The breakfast was very dried up especially the fried eggs bacon and sausages The breakfast restaurant also dated and opened floor panels showing rotten floor boards with different patches on the carpets The hotel used to be our family Xmas dinner and last attended about 10years ago and seeing the same floor carpets layouts and decorations still remained the same not to talk about the underground car park unkept ,3.0

5917, Not much to be honest The only point at favour of the Hotel is that they have an Italian restaurant open till 1 00am in the night so if you are hungry you can go there to ask for a pizza only pizza not pasta and take it to your room because you are not allowed neither to have lunch in the restaurant after 21 00pm ,0.75

5944, Liked the idea of how the hotel is laid out The staff are very friendly and helpful I cannot fault them in anyway they are a credit to their profession The location of the hotel is good even though its surrounded by building sites The surrounding building work makes access from Canary Wharf awkward and frustrating I loved the restaurants and swimming pool and I also think Friday s bar is a great addition to the hotel Even though the hotel is run down it s very clean and tidy And it does have some nice quirky features Like the Japanese statutes dotted around the place I loved them I think the sofas in the lobby are a nice and relaxing touch too while waiting for a cab or as a rendezvous point All in all its a nice enough hotel all be it a little disappointing when you consider what you are paying for it But it has the potential of being much better If a bit of money is spent on it Considering its in the heart of London s financial district I was expecting a bit more refinement The hot tub in my room was clean but but very worn out also the carpet in the room is old worn out I had a good sizeroom but could definitely benefit with a bigger TV with the options of sky channels However the nice big bed and the linen were fresh and comfy Theres a fantastic view from balcony of the docklands shame about all the building worksites at present it does spoil the view The room service menu is good and unexpectedly good value A mini bar and safe would be a great addition to the room Wifi should be free considering the price you pay for the room I loved the iron spiral staircase in the room another great quirky feature All in all a nice hotel that could be so much more if the owners are willing to invest a little cash and attention to it It is rather run down and in a desperate need of freshening up For this reason alone I think it was over priced ,5.0

6659, After managing to lose our car keys after a few too many cocktails the staff were so helpful and understanding The bar downstairs is beautifully situated on the river Thames and prices were incredible along with the views After originally booking the hotel for one night and ending up staying for two the rooms were perfect well equipped with a decent sized TV and comfortable bed which was perfect for cheese and biscuits after a little too much wine The room sizes are lovely and big so there s plenty of space for getting ready and spreading different outfits all over the place The hotel itself was beautiful and clean This hotel is now our first choice for everytime we come back to London Situated 5 minutes from the tube and 2 minutes away from a couple of quirky bars and a huge shopping mall Highly recommend ,1.0
