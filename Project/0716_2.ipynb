      "[\"[' The car park was small and unpleasant People with Mercedes and BMWs took over 2 spaces We were lucky to get a space after driving around about 10 times ', ' We weren t told that the only spa facility open was the pool and the sauna but we had already paid and had to find out ourselves when entering the spa area ', ' I asked how far the O2 was and got told a 7 minute walk no no way it was 2 trains away being on my own I was not very happy other than that it was ok', ' Hot stuffy room air con not working properly Filthy windows Wallpaper ripped and worn bedside furniture tatty carpets worn and damaged bathroom door latch worn making door difficult to open from the inside Shower from another era controlled by bath taps Poor shower curtain too resulting in wet floor Carpets in corridors worn out and tatty nasty musty aroma to these areas too All in all this place is around ten years overdue a complete renovation ', ' Although the price seems like it is cheap you have to pay extra for everything like the swimming pool and Wifi which can fool you and sometimes comes to the same as others if not more with extras like breakfast and all ', ' The hotel has seen better days including the stairwell carpets which were quite threadbare The common parts are in need of decoration The quality of the towels in the bathroom was not too good and there was only one set of toiletries for two people There was an item of drug paraphernalia in the hall ', ' Construction going on all around the hotel so many paths closed Had to pay extra to use hotel pool and spa which was a health hazard in itself Stairs leading to changing rooms and pool were filthy pool tiles didn t look like they had ever been cleaned wood was rotted in the sauna floor had food and hair on it outside The shower outside sauna had a hot and a cold button had to press both at same time in order not to scald or freeze yourself Pasta in pizzaria was microwaved Staff were incredibly rude in all areas of the hotel at one point my aunt was asked to repeat if you understand now The wifi was incredibly slow and power points or lack there of were very dated like the decor in whole hotel The only part of this review I gave more than a sad face was the location I wouldn t even give the hotel a 2 ', ' Room was far too hot and air conditioning didn t work Happened on my previous stay and a staff member had to open a window with a screwdriver Unfortunately the huge vents outside were really noisy with the window open Hardly slept all night ', ' The guy that served us was not very professional as he was telling us about other customers situation and we just wanted to get to our room The car park was so small and there was no parking at all My car was stuck between two cars all they told us he was a first come first serve Was not very happy at all ', ' The building site next door Dirty windows spoiling lovely view See photos ', ' Access was a little tricky due to local construction works in the area but these did not adversely impact on my journey time or cause any noise issues inside the hotel ', ' ', ' The staff were not at all welcoming I would go so far as to say jaded if not unhappy at obe point seen arguing with a customer in front of customers The double bed I selected wasn t a double bed at all but two single beds zipped together and very poorly and uncomfortably at that So cheap Such a bad sleep There were mice scurrying around all over the property in full view of customers from the main lobby to near the dining and bar areas to inside my room where I saw mice on two occasions during my stay The room itself had too much wear and tear with walls visibly stained marked and damaged and the toilets showing mould in the shower Totally careless I asked for a non smoking room but the room I got reeked of smoke everywhere from the curtains to the toilet So bad I want a full refund ', ' The lifts were badly adjusted with dangerous gaps between the leading edges og the car doors ', ' Parking was horrible The parking garage is very narrow and we drove in and out again when noticng it was full Near the entrance of the garage there were 3 members of staff walking around who did not inform anyone At least 4 other cars behind us drove in and back out again Then I walked up to ask where else we could park in the area and were told to just check out all the side streets and park there Then we drove around to find out that all parking there is for residents only After 30 minutes or so when then parked at the westferry circus garage which is a 10 minute walk away Since the garage did not mention maximum duration of parking we On the hotel itself the furnishings are a little outdated The carpets on the stairs for instance are quite worn Wifi did not work There was a card in the room with details but the network could not be found on either of the phones we had with The room itself was nice and clean Beware of the shower Water pressure is very good but the screen in front of the bath is fairly small so if you do not twist the shower head to the wall for an inch or so the whole bathroom will get wet The head is fixed to the wall and people over approx 1 85 m will not be able to stand under without squatting a little If I would have paid full price for this hotel frankly I would have been very disappointed Comparing to some 3 and 4 star hotels in London I have visited this hotel is more a 3 than a 4 star based on room comfort staff and parking ', ' Every part of this stay was horrendous From start to finish When we arrived the sockets did not work so could not charge our phones before heading out for dinner The room was dirty I Woke up in the morning to the bathroom flooded water had come all the way out to the room wetting bags shoes toiletry bags etc Could not get reception on phone for ages Nobody came to clean the mess could not get hold of a GM breakfast was awful Dry toast was all we could stomach eating as place was so dirty Needless to say we are in process of looking for a full refund from the hotel ', ' NOTHING', ' Bathroom could of been to a better standard but everything in the bathroom did work perfectly fine ', ' The phone wasn t working in the room The steam room was out of action They the Sheff wasn t there to make sandwiches all day on menu there was no body there to do the massage in spa And when I mentioned my concerns to the staff and management they seemed not bothered about the issues Or to give a solution All round I think the the management and staff need to listen to the guests You can t offer these facilities without providing them ', ' Nothing it was great ', ' Hotel is very tired and overpriced for what it is Needs knocking down and replacing or complete renovation Beds poor with thin mattresses 2 singles pushed together to be a double etc ', ' The room I had could do with a bit of a spruce up especially the the en suite bathroom However it was all clean The Pizzeria in the hotel served very poor food The Indian retaurant in the hotel served deceent food ', ' As above', ' WiFi is not for free which felt a bit like early 2000 s', ' The fire alarm went off and no one said anything i wasnt sure if i needed to get out or not but by the time i put my clothing back on from swimming the alarm atopped so i stayed in my room also when i went swimming noe one told me i had to sign in this is something reception shld have told me whn i checked in as i did ask her the swimming times', ' Staff Those of you with poker faces you should smile more you should ask a guest whether is in a need of help with luggage not just whether he she wants to pay in advance for breakfast or open an account with you or whether would prefer a more expensive room Also saying good morning and good evening to your guests once in a while is good manners Looking like a gentleman won t make you one after all it s not everything in life about money Wifi Rooms with windows at an extra charge of 20 pounds day Taxi companies you co operate with that instead of 5 mins they turn up in 35 It s not your fault entirely but most definitely not your guests ', ' ', ' ', ' There was no toilet brush The bathroom was generally threadbare There was no ability to tightly close the window therefore it was very cold in the night Also guests next door were pretty loud ', ' Hotel and staff a little sad need a bit of updating sprucing up Lovely to have a pool but the whole area was not very clean and needs more than a lick of paint ', ' The rooms did not look like the ones on the picture I had to change rooms because the first one was not what I expected Booked two single beds however the beds were only one armlength apart The closet door was broken Whn I asked the receptionist about the room on the pictures displayed on booking com I was told that those rooms do not exist Staff was friendly enough to over us a different room which was okay The furnishing was really outdated I was shocked that this is supposed to be a four star hotel There was no air conditioning in the room While it was only 15 C outside the roomtemperature was around 28 5 C Turning on the air ventilation was in vain and also incredibly loud ', ' The angle of the TV was a bit annoying it was postioned facing away from the bed which I thought to be very strange The bathroom floor was quite slippy I nearly slipped and died The room was so hot too The air con just didn t do it any justice We couldn t feel it at all Due to the old fashioned theme of the hotel I believe they could probably upgrade the air con and possibly modernise it a bit more The armchairs though comfortable did have a huge rip down the back of it which I thought was a bit crude considering the location and the amount of visitors they must have ', ' Rooms on the first floor do not have air conditioning Our rooms were unbearably hot Breakfast was poor ', ' Walking access from the train station was convoluted because of building works ', ' The build is not a new infraestructure the room was old fashion ', ' There was no water in the complimentry tray with tea and coffee There is NO fridge Carpet are old and smelly WiFi not available in rooms No free parking ', ' At breakfast not shown to table or offered tea or coffee Tables filthy standard of food appalling had a few mouthfuls and left Check out only one person checking guests out as another left to work in back office Not asked about my stay and not interested in me as a customer or future business Does not compare to the Hilton Group ', ' Hotel very tired don t see how it can be classed as 4star room ver hot no airconditon no windows in some rooms', ' Staff achieved the bare minimum of helpfulness but no desire to add value or go the extra mile Room was mostly clean but glasses in bathroom and and other objects were dusty ', ' Bathroom was old dirty and dated The basin did not work and the shower which was incorporated in the bath did not work well The breakfast was awful the coffee tasted bad the bacon smelt off there was little choice no continental option or very little the food looked unappealing and stale The cutlery plates and cups were dirty and felt greasy I tried to eat but felt distgusted and bought breakfast outside the hotel ', ' We couldn t stay all night as parking was full and there wasn t any parking nearby A quick call to reception for advise was unhelpful as they advised it was unsafe to park anywhere else The hotel parking on its own did not seem too secure either There is no access from the parking levels straight into the hotel pedestrians have to walk up and down the same way as cars go which is risky and a tad inconvenient too ', ' Beds not comfy tried to charge us 20 night to upgrade to a room with windows when we had a room with windows anyway Booked a double room and given a twin room with 2beds pushed together complained changed room to a double Rooms very dated and old ', ' Cumbersome check in process poor wifi connectivity quality of breakfast should be better it should have a separate breakfast room or serving point for large groups of travelling children ', ' Breakfast was rubbish with the restaurant more like a canteen in Butlins ', ' The room was shabby with worn carpet and furniture The bed was uncomfortable The breakfast was disorganised and not of a quality that would be expected of a large city hotel Wifi was not really usable due to 20min per day Having to pay extra for hotel facilities eg pool ', ' Extremely disappointing No free Internet in room and you have to pay for every device you want connected once per day The breakfast buffet was not good For example the yogurt had the consistency of water The room itself had cracked yellow water stained drywall or plaster ceiling Sink didn t drain A C somewhat worked but the vent was almost plugged with dust They staff was definitely not very friendly but did their job adequately You ll survive a stay here but you aren t likely to particularly enjoy it I ve stayed at many roadside motels over the years that were cleaner nicer and a way way better value This is not a 4 star hotel experience If you arrive with the mindset that it s a place to sleep and won t be eating there won t need Internet won t spend any time in your room and don t sweat small stuff like a sink that won t drain it will be okay Otherwise probably try somewhere else ', ' It was very old fashioned and tired looking in many areas Would definitely benifit from a refit The shower in our room was very basic and sprayed all over the place which was very annoying while trying to get ready The plug socket nearest to the bed was an original fitting and so couldn t actually be used with a modern plug Very basic overall rough around the edges ', ' The rooms aircon was noisy and not very effective The view was a aircon unit upon a roof and the whole experience made me feel I was back in the 80 s We stopped there as I was attending a conference at The Excell Centre and when I typed in hotels close to the Docklands it bought this one up It was close to the other side of the Docklands which then still cost us 15 in a cab to reach Shame as booking com have let themselves down with this hotel ', ' Unfortunately the rooms are a bit dated and the carpet could have been cleaner as there were stains on it ', ' Hotel staff was not cooperating at all Beds were separated Spring Mattress were paining in back like hell Bathroom sinks were choked Had to brush in Bath tubs Cleaning staff was pathetic Swimming pool was chargeable Internet wi fi was free for a whole 20 minute session in whole day and that too in hotel lobby and not in room Overall the property was not value for money at all and staying there was a nightmare ', ' The room had no air conditioning and the windows don t open and the heat was well in the 20c all night building work a few yards off the building so the windows are dirty staff very good ', ' No air conditioning in rooms When paying over 100 a night you would expect air con However the room did have a little fan to help blow the hot air around the room Also I left some expensive items in the bathroom but when I called the next day the receptionist informed me nothing was handed in Can t say surprised but very disappointed ', ' wifi was a bit complicated you are allowed to use free wifi 2 times for 20 min in a day in the room if you want all day hotel requests extra money but in the lobby area it was free so people were sitting in the lobby area on the evenings ', ' Wifi not free after 30 mins really considering it s 2017 Electric sockets near bed side were unusable as they were 3 pin again It s 2017 the rooms need to facilitate modern technology use and ease of access Food price good but bland bland bland Poor mass produced deserts', ' Overpriced No good value for money ', ' Nothing', ' She room upstairs are a bit dated and the lefts take forever to come had to use the stairs at one point ', ' The staffs who were there in the morning don t use words called thank you and sorry We couldn t have breakfast because there was a very long queue When we requested for a refund for the breakfast the lady at the check out counter gave us a rude look and said non refundable A polite word would do the magic The food at the Indian restaurant was not up to the mark ', ' The hotel was a bit far from the sight seeing and tourist activities that we had planned The walk to the underground was a bit far also Spent a lot of time traveling to and from London Center Also the construction made finding the entrance difficult and it was a bit noisy ', ' The facilities and decoration are so old ', ' The queue for the breakfast was very long and not worth waiting in Very expensive for what the hotel offered and there is nothing around the hotel at all The tube station is around a 5 10min walk ', ' There was a strange sound through the whole of the night and called the manager to try and fix the problem Next day he said the problem was fixed after he sent a maintenance team The second night of course the sound was there It was a sound which resembled a phone vibrating which come from the ceiling bathroom For the 4 star rating is not acceptable Another issue there was not any fridge in the room ', ' The bed was like sleeping on a chain link fence and the neighbors and hallway were noisy ', ' I know I booked a budget room but I didn t realize rooms without windows even existed anymore but that s what I got Nor did it have air conditioning Just a fan The daytime temperatures were about 30 degrees so I had two uncomfortable nights Had I known all this in advance I probably would have paid more for something better or an Airbnb I actually dreamed about being on holiday in North Korea It was that good My other gripe was the length of time it took to get a beer Short queues at the bar took forever to get to the front of mainly because people were buying huge rounds of drinks The bar girl did her best but the odds were stacked against her More bar staff might be an idea Plenty of people without my determination and unquenchable thirst gave up and I don t blame them My third and final gripe is the external camouflage of the hotel which is labelled the P Hotel outside with no obvious clue as to its claimed name of Britannia International For a non London dweller like me simple things like this matter quite a lot when I am hot and tired and lost ', ' No mention of an extra charge for leisure facilities online or when checked in Had to go up to the room again to get cash When queried this at reception the lady was unhelful unfriendly and unapologetic One manager was very friendly and helpful however other staff did not smile or make conversation Leisure facilities were very poor The rest of the hotel was clean and tidy Leisure area carpet was filthy dirty rubbish bag on the floor carpet looked like it had not been hoovered Sauna was cold pool was cold pool area was outdated including walls peeling generally run down Dirty flannel at side of hot tub ', ' The rooms need a bit of a facelift The double bed is made up of two singles stuck together New carpet is needed ', ' My experience with this hotel was quite bad as follows When we had arrived we were not greeted at the entrance by any concierge or bellboy and left to us to take our luggage into the hotel ourselves but once we got to the front desk I began speaking to one of the staff and was rudely interrupted by another most likely more senior staff who insisted on assisting with my check in Once all of the particulars were given it was time to speak about the payment even though I had already made the booking and payment through booking com What annoyed me tremendously is the way in which I was spoken to it seems many hotels in London have staff with attitude problems where they speak to guests as if they cannot afford the stay so to speak Quite infuriating and pretty much set the precedent for the rest of the stay The bed was ridiculously small for 2 people if you make a half turn from the centre of the bed you are already at the edge of the bed Good luck if you toss and turn during sleep don t be surprised to find yourself waking up on the floor The room looked tired and unattractive the carpets were frayed inside the room and in the corridor and all of the furniture in the room was worn and tired I approached the front desk requesting assistance in organising a chauffeured ride to Heathrow Airport and instead of assisting me the front desk staff just told me to speak to the concierge Nothing wrong with that but the problem in this case was that there was no human being at the concierge desk which was right across on the right hand side of the staff member All she had to do was look to the right and she would have seen there was no one there In any case I walked across waiting 10 minutes for someone to come but no one appeared which was quite disturbing I just gave up in the end and used an online booking service instead ', ' ', ' The coffee was undrinkable The air con was pathetic When 2 coach loads of new guests all arrived together it took 3 4 of an hour to be able to use the lifts ', ' Hotel a little tired needs a refurb and surrounded by a building g site at the moment', ' The staff at reception should have greeted us with a smile They did get more smiley after my partner made a joke or two but it had to be prompted ', ' Paid for wifi in 2017 Really Even the free 20 minutes wouldn t let me VPN or tunnel traffic to access remote systems for my work just basic browsing possible I travel to Canary Wharf for business most weeks this one problem puts Britannia at the bottom of the accommodation options for me The windows were dirty outside so the advantage of a good viewpoint was negated Windows wouldn t open aircon not up to the job min temp max fan and the room was still too warm it would have been fine if a window was able to be opened Furnishings decor were functionally fine but a little dated and shabby ', ' Uncomfortable bed pillow Windows didn t open and air con was very poor Shower flooded entire bathroom and fell off wall continually when spoke to reception rude stated it s hand held only didn t say that in their description of facilities Breakfast was horrible

concierge to get a trolley ourselves Once maneuvered onto correct floor had to get two very heavy cases and two smaller up 6 stairs then get them through the maze of corridors that were semi blocked with maids trolleys The hotel felt more like a hostel with crowds of youngsters congregating in the lobby for coaches then in the evening slouched over the sofas some asleep Every morning we were woken early by loud shouting down the corridors from what appeared to possibly be construction workers Most awful hotel experience I ve ever had which constrasted greatly with that when this hotel

out to help Both single beds in the room were very basic narrow beds which looked and felt rather temporary the bed was comfortable enough but it seemed a bit cheeky for the price That plus getting only 20 minutes free wifi made it feel slightly over priced ', ' The air con in our room was broken on the hottest day of the year we were unable to open the windows fans were provided but they only

spoke to the manager about the problems and he offered a room change we d already unpacked and got as settled as we could so all I wanted was the upgrade money back That didn t happen The breakfast the next morning was not worth the 10 each The bacon was like cardboard the eggs didn t taste right and the whole breakfast was a huge let down So the price started on here as 73 I ended up paying 150

either red hot or freezing cold The windows in the downstairs bar were absolutely filthy the air con also didn t work anywhere on the ground floor The furniture in the downstairs bar and foyer area need replacing as it had pieces of tape holding splits in the leather together The staff behind reception were grumpy and were not helpful at all the staff in breakfast were all young children and were lacking leadership and needed to be motivated there were many tables uncleaned with the previous persons plates still sat there the presentation of the food looked rushed and was chucked in dishes to try and keep up with the masses of people queuing to get into breakfast I actually went in for breakfast early prior to going for a meeting and was waiting so long I had to leave as I would

degrees The next night I had to keep the door open for a couple of hours to get the temperature to drop a little It was not a problem of my room as I talked to other guests and they were all experiencing the same Breakfast quite basic and this would be OK but a small buffet at the end of a stretched room meant a long queue to just get some fruits In a nutshell don t get this hotel in

espresso and the waiter wouldn t even know what it was I am often in London but I will try to stay away from this hotel as much as it s possible in the area Such an historical building should be much

depressing place it is hard to imagine staying at and it is not worth anyting like the rates they charge I paid 140 for one night in my opinion I have stayed at far better hotels charging 50 per night

there is no opening for the windows I would stay again but not on the same side as our room 824 ', ' The room smelt of old stale smoke It was a none smoking floor so it was either the airconditioning filters that needed changing or the room was close to an external vent where people were smoking The room was on the 10th floor so it wasn t close to an outside smoking area Very puzzling Also the furniture and decor in the room was looking scratched marked and aged Though the room was clean it certainly was overdue for a refurbishment considering it s a 4 hotel in Canary Wharf ', ' I think the hotel was overpriced for a 4 I have stayed in numerous 4 hotels and this has to be one of the worst I had paid for a double room but when I arrived I found that it was two single beds pushed together

evidence that the paid option of 7 Pounds is far too high I suggest you trial a promotional offer of 50 off for a week your revenue will easily exceed current levels and your lobby area won t look like a Public Library ', ' Nothing It was amazing ', ' I think the hotel could do with a bit more attention to detail when it comes to presentation I feel it could do with a bit of a revamp It s a

a double So I had to book the double and pay for it So we are paying for 2 rooms because of the hotel This all seemed unethical and the heat in the room was frankly dangerous I moved on from this but was still annoyed but what felt like the unfair loss of 65 The next day we moved to another room that the hotel said was cooler and it was for a moment but again there was no AC and no window so the heat eventually stated to build up The cleaner barely cleaned the room when asked to and attempted to just flip over the dirty pillow cases instead of changing them Asked for a fan 3 times before receiving one Attempted to complain politely a number of times 1st manager said he could do nothing Customer services said to contact booking com to attempt to get a refund as if booking com put us in a room where the heating was broken and stuck as 28 degrees and booking com could try and get a refund if the hotel is and I quote WILLING to cooperate Last complaint was to an AWFUL AWFUL manager who essentially said I had to accept the fact that I spent a ridiculous amount of money on a second room that day as hard luck Gave a half assed apology I ll admit to being rude myself but felt justified This isnt as detailed as I would like but in short I kept extending my stay here because the location is the most convenient for my work but this place is just awful and non of the prices justifiable

everything was settled only to be literally thrown out of my room and told i had to check in again on the last day unfortunately all of that sums up into a strong and lasting impression resembling a

arrangement than obliging to commit all days of the reservation 4 The room service was not efficient and in 2 occasion I had to remind the reception of doing the room In one instance they forgot to do the room and then in the afternoon was too late I also asked twice to have the shampoo and shower gel In both occasion they forgot to supply the material 5 The telephone in the room is not designed to

to the reception staff to pass this message on The GM should have been there ', ' Unfortunately a power cut meant that we paid 20 for a breakfast that comprised of crossiants and cereal There was

40am stood at the sign to be seated and staff just looked at us and carried on clearing tables I then approached a staff member and asked if we were just to sit anywhere and they smiled and said yes

s a real shame as it could be a lovely hotel but I m under the impression that it s really neglected ', ' The reception staff was extremely rude and could not speak English properly the staff made up a story that I used vulgar language which was a lie I then asked for the manager who corrected the situation This occurred the first time at reception on check in But the next day I was complaining about the bar staff attitude and again the staff made up a story that I used vulgar language The staff at this hotel clearly lie and accuse guests of things which are not true I will be taking these

stale or fresh cigarettes Breakfast should be included at the price you are charging Also I was annoyed that I had to pay for WIFI As I had to stay for 3 nights a small built in fridge would have been useful for me to keep some food drinks I also think not being able to leave any personal items in a hotel room is worrying There was a card on the table advising your guests not to leave anything valuable in the room In order for you to print these cards distribute them in every room means items must be going walkies on a regular basis That was a little concerning Every day I had to bring my laptop kindle phone charger to work with me ', ' Weekend staff took 30 minutes to attend to us to check us in on arrival They were unfriendly and dismissive Didn t answer phone despite repeated

overground There was even a smell of cigarettes although it was a non smoking room Also the heater in my room was not working The Air conditionning was put at 25 degrees As i was cold at night i called reception and they sent me a heater Of course the heater was in very poor condition and no one noticed that the plug was completly burned I had to call reception again to get another heater The

this hotel again ', ' Could not adjust room temperature only by staff opening window Worked but let all other noise in Not ideal', ' Our room was really run down and was like a sauna We called

was dated there was people all over the place drinking cans of Stella and couldn t get any staff to help us with anything After complaining and requesting a refund as it completely ruined our stay and 140 pound for the service just isn t good enough We were offered a COMPLIMENTARY UPGRADE for next time we stay We won t be staying ever again and an UPGRADE costs 20 pound on top of minimum 140 so

nice quirky features Like the Japanese statutes dotted around the place I loved them I think the sofas in the lobby are a nice and relaxing touch too while waiting for a cab or as a rendezvous point All in all its a nice enough hotel all be it a little disappointing when you consider what you are paying for it But it has the potential of being much better If a bit of money is spent on it

had a good sizeroom but could definitely benefit with a bigger TV with the options of sky channels However the nice big bed and the linen were fresh and comfy Theres a fantastic view from balcony of the docklands shame about all the building worksites at present it does spoil the view The room service menu is good and unexpectedly good value A mini bar and safe would be a great addition to the room Wifi should be free considering the price you pay for the room I loved the iron spiral staircase in the room another great quirky feature All in all a nice hotel that could be so much more if the
